# Snapples
Snapples is word association game using user generated snaps of user generated topics.

<h3>Purpose:</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  The main purpose of this project is to learn swift<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  A secondary purpose of this project is map out my idea of a good app (still a work in progress)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  The next step in this project is to refine my ideas and write a better version using React Native<br />

<h3>Included in this project:</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. podfile (for installing dependencies)
  
  2. Snapples (folder containing all code of the code I have written in swift and corresponding UI nib files)<br />
    a. last update was converting code to swift 4<br />
    b. updating to swift 4 broke the facebook login to my code,  so that part of this project was gutted and not included<br />
    c. Incomplete: Made it all the way to getting users to access camera,  however the snaps never make it to storage<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  User generated topic section has yet to be created<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  User rating system has yet to be created<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The "game" aspect has yet to be created<br />
    d. Broken: the views seem to be broken for plus models,  this issue arrose from updating code to swift 4<br />
    
  <h3>Available upon request: </h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. SnapplesDB (folder containing my api written with django rest framework)<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. This db has become mostly useless with in the current project due to ios 11 gutting facebook login<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The intentions of this db was to take a graph request from users and automating a profile for them<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Incomplete: there is no user validation for the Db, also never made it to storage of links to uploaded snaps<br />
    2.  Older Versions<br />
       a. There is an older version where the app uses a scrollview instead of a custom navigation bar
